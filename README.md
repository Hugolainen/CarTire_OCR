# CarTire_OCR
IPSI3: School Project

A character recognition software for car tires. Based on 3D images of car tires, we developed an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) application able to efficiently read information such as the tire’s DOT (Tire Identification Number). The manufacturing date was then extracted and used to validate or not the possibility of selling the tire according to regulation and customer’s criteria.
